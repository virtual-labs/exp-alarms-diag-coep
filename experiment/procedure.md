##### Here is a procedure for developing an event and alarm diagram for the smooth running of a plant as per international standard:

Procedure for Developing an Event and Alarm Diagram

#### Step 1: Identify Events and Alarms

Identify the events and alarms that need to be monitored and controlled in the plant, including:

-	Process variables (e.g., temperature, pressure, flow)
-	Equipment status (e.g., running, stopped, fault)
-	Alarm conditions (e.g., high temperature, low pressure)

#### Step 2: Determine Alarm Priorities

Determine the priority of each alarm, based on:

-	Severity of the alarm condition
-	Impact on plant operation and safety
-	Urgency of response required

#### Step 3: Define Alarm Messages

Define the alarm messages that will be displayed to operators, including:

-	Alarm text and description
-	Alarm priority and severity
-	Recommended response and actions

#### Step 4: Develop the Event and Alarm Diagram

Develop the event and alarm diagram, using:

-	A graphical representation of the plant process and equipment
-	Symbols and notation to represent events and alarms
-	Arrows and lines to show the flow of events and alarms

#### Step 5: Identify Alarm Triggering Points

-	Identify the alarm triggering points, including:

-	Sensor and instrument locations
-	Set-points and trip points
-	Logic and programming for alarm generation

#### Step 6: Define Alarm Response Procedures

Define the alarm response procedures, including:
-	Operator response and actions
-	Maintenance and repair procedures
-	Escalation procedures for critical alarms

#### Step 7: Review and Refine

Review and refine the event and alarm diagram, including:

-	Verification of alarm triggering points and response procedures
-	Validation of alarm messages and priorities
-	Review of alarm philosophy and design

#### Step 8: Implement and Test

Implement and test the event and alarm diagram, including:

-	Configuration of alarm systems and devices
-	Testing of alarm triggering points and response procedures
-	Verification of alarm messages and priorities

International Standards for Event and Alarm Diagrams

The event and alarm diagram should be developed in accordance with international standards, such as:
-	ISA (International Society of Automation) standard 18.2, "Management of Alarm Systems for the Process Industries"
-	IEC (International Electrotechnical Commission) standard 61511, "Functional Safety - Safety Instrumented Systems for the Process Industry Sector"
-	API (American Petroleum Institute) standard 754, "Process Safety Performance Indicators for the Refining and Petrochemical Industries"

Example of an Event and Alarm Diagram
Here is an example of an event and alarm diagram for a process plant:
This is a simplified example, and the actual event and alarm diagram will vary depending on the specific plant and its requirements.

By following this procedure, you can ensure that events and alarms are properly monitored and controlled, and that operators are alerted and respond appropriately to abnormal conditions in the plant.
